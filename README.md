# SigProPy - A Python module for digital signal processing

> Joseph Vantassel, University of Texas at Austin

## Getting Started

After downloading and unzipping the repository:

1. Open File Explorer and navigate to the downloaded and unzipped repository.
Open a Windows Powershell (recommended) or Command Prompt console inside this
directory. If using Windows Powershell you can do this with
`shift + right click` on the directory and selecting the option
`open PowerShell window here`. If using Command Prompt you will need to navigate
to that directory using the console.

2. Ensure you are in the correct directory by confirming it contains a
sub-directory call `sigpropy` and a file named `setup.py`. You can see the
contents of the current directory by using the command `ls` in Windows
Powershell or `dir` in Command Prompt.

3. If in the correct directory, install the module's dependencies with
`pip install -r requirements.txt`. Note that an internet connection is required
for the installation to be successful.

4. And install the module itself with `pip install .`.

5. Confirm that `sigpropy` was built successfully by reading the last few
lines printed to the console.
