sigpropy Documentation
======================

`sigpropy` is a Python package for digital signal processing. It includes two
main class definitions, `TimeSeries` and `FourierTransform`. These classes
include methods to perform common signal processing techniques (e.g., trimming
and resampling) and properties to make using them readable and intuitive.

This package and the classes therein are being used in several other
Python projects, some of which have been released publicly and others are
still in the development stage, so if you do not see a feature you would like
it may very well be under development and released in the near future. To be
notified of future releases, you can either ``watch`` the repository on
`Github <https://github.com/jpvantassel/sigpropy>`_ or
``Subscribe to releases`` on the
`Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/project/sigpropy/>`_.
