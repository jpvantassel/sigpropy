SigProPy Documentation
======================

Summary
-------
`SigProPy` is Python module for digital signal processing. `SigProPy` was
developed by Joseph P. Vantassel under the supervision of Professor Brady R.
Cox at the University of Texas at Austin.

The module includes two main class definitons `TimeSeries` and
`FourierTransform`. These classes include various methods for creating and
manipulating time series and Fourier transforms, respectively.
